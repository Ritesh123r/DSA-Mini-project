🧭 Task 3 - The Trial of the Cheater’s Path
✅ Problem Statement:
Navigate a maze from node AAA to ZZZ using left/right instructions. Two parts:

Part 2: Start at all nodes ending in 'A', reach nodes ending in 'Z' simultaneously.

📌 Features:
Input parsing from a file or manually.

Graph traversal logic implemented using maps.

Handles repetitive patterns via modular arithmetic or cycle detection.
